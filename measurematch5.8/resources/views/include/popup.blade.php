        <h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully as this is a legally binding contract between any entity be it an individual contractor or a consultant or a company wishing to provide marketing services to Clients either direct or via a service company and MeasureMatch Limited (trading as MeasureMatch) ("<strong>MM</strong>"), together referred to as “Parties”. You indicate that you accept these Terms of Service and that you agree to be bound by them. These Terms of Service also incorporate the terms of use of the MM website set out in the Schedule. The Terms of Service are later referred to as "this agreement".</p>
        <h4>Information about MM</h4>
        <p>MM operates the website <a href="{{url('/',[],$ssl)}}" target="_blank">https://measurematch.com</a> ("Website"). MM is a company incorporated in England and Wales with company number 10199524 whose registered office is at 5th Floor (744-750) Salisbury House, London Wall, London, London, England, EC2M 5QQ. MM’s VAT number is 253943881.</p>
        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>MM provides a specialised online marketplace ("<strong>Platform</strong>") which links business users ("<strong>Clients</strong>") with individual contractors, consultants or companies who have registered via the Website ("<strong>Experts</strong>"). Clients and Experts are able to conduct a dialogue about prospective engagements and enter into direct agreements for the provision of relevant Projects. Any such agreements are a matter for negotiation and resolution between Clients and Experts alone. MM is solely the provider of a marketplace infrastructure to enable such agreements to be defined, agreed and concluded.</p>
        <p>The Platform enables Experts to feature their services and allows Clients to solicit interest in published work opportunities ("<strong>Project(s)</strong>"). The Platform incorporates an online escrow payment mechanism through which services are paid for and MM’s fees are deducted. MM shall provide, operate and maintain the required technology to host the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Registration on the Platform as a Expert is not intended to and does not operate as a promise or guarantee of any kind by MM to a Expert that it will be successful in any tender for Projects.</p>
        <p>The Platform enables Experts and Clients to agree on the details of Projects including the nature, timing, content and price. The point at which these details have been agreed is described in these Terms of Service as a "<strong>Project Booking</strong>" and the conclusion of a Project will be set out in a mutually agreed confirmation via the Platform ("<strong>Project Confirmation</strong>").</p>
        <p><em>MM is remunerated by way of: (i) a commission fee for the booking as in force and communicated to the Expert from time to time; and (ii) the notified administrative fee from time to time.
</em></p>
             <h4>2. Registration</h4>
             <p>Experts can only seek to access the Platform for business use only and all Experts must complete the registration form on the Website which incorporates a user profile (“Profile”). Each Expert consents to the publication on the Website of its Profile and only individuals who are registered on the Website either directly in their own names or indirectly through a company can tender for Projects. MM has absolute discretion to decide whether to approve or reject a registration. By registering on the Website, an Expert warrants: (i) that it is legally capable of entering into binding contracts and (ii) where the Expert registers as an individual and not through a company that he or she is at least 18 years old.</p>
             <p>An Expert is obliged to keep its registered information up-to-date and it is responsible for any consequences of any failure to do this. MM reserves the right to verify the identity of any person seeking to register as an Expert and an Expert hereby authorises MM to make such checks (whether by way of identity documentation or enquiries of third parties) as are reasonable and necessary.</p>
             <p>Each Expert will be required to choose a username and password ("<strong>Access Information</strong>") in order to access the Platform and shall be solely responsible for safeguarding such Access Information and keeping it confidential. Each Expert shall notify MM immediately should it believe that unauthorised use has been made of Access Information or its account has been accessed without authorisation..</p>
             <p>By registering for an account or by clicking to accept these Terms of Service when prompted on the Website, a Expert is deemed to have entered into this Agreement electronically, with effect from the date of registration.</p>
             <h4>3. Feedback </h4>
             <p>An important feature of the Platform is its feedback functionality. Each Expert confirms on registration that MM is authorised to post feedback, whether in published Profiles or elsewhere on the Website. Feedback results for each Expert will consist of comments, Client service ratings, other indicators of Client satisfaction, and other feedback left by other Experts and will be freely available to all persons registered to access the Platform.  MM does not monitor or censor feedback comments or the opinions expressed.  Feedback is provided solely to make use of the Platform more efficient and no person may use feedback comments for any other purpose.</p>
             <p>MM does not monitor content in the feedback section but will do so if asked. Any Expert expressing opinions or posting comments may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Experts or third parties as a result of its remarks if such remarks are legally actionable or defamatory.  MM is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Website by any Experts or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.  In order to protect the integrity of the feedback system and protect individuals from abuse, MM reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that, in MM’s sole judgment, violates these Terms of Service or negatively affects the Platform or the reputation of the marketplace that MM offers.  </p>
             <h4>4. Access to the Platform</h4>
             <p>An Expert may access the Platform and submit a tender for Projects only if it is not restricted from doing so by contractual, fiduciary or other obligation(s). By completing the registration form and accessing the Platform, a Expert warrants that it is not restricted from providing Project services for Clients and that it has obtained all necessary approvals.</p>
             <h4>5. Right to accept or decline</h4>
             <p>An Expert is free at any time prior to payment by the Client of the Project Work fee as referred to in section 7 below to accept or decline any request from a Client to provide Project services at its sole discretion, provided that it may only provide services that:</p>
             <p>(a) do not carry any conflict of interests;</p>
             <p>(b) it is permitted to conduct under applicable laws and any restrictions it may have (including contractual, employment, or otherwise); and</p>
             <p>(c) it is technically able to deliver to the standard reasonably expected by the Client assuming the Client has in turn been clear as to its requirements.</p>
             <h4>6. Warranties</h4>
             <p>Each Expert warrants that:</p>
             <p>(a) its conduct of any Project services and the content and format of any materials used or supplied will not infringe the copyright rights or other intellectual property rights of any third party and hereby indemnifies MM from and against any costs claims damages or expenses (including reasonable legal expenses) that it may incur or suffer as a result of any breach of this warranty; and</p>
             <p>(b) it has adequate insurance (including travel insurance) in respect of conduct of the relevant Projects</p>
             <h4>7. Expert’s obligations</h4>
             <p>Each Expert agrees:</p>

                <li><span>c)</span> <span>that MM has generated marketing leads for it by being given access to a database of Clients and prospective Projects that has been built up over time and at great cost to MM and that therefore it is reasonable for the Expert to commit not to seek to circumvent the Platform by directly or indirectly soliciting Clients for the purposes of booking Projects at any time whilst registered as a Expert and for a period of 12 months after ceasing to be registered as a Expert;</span></li>
                <li><span>d)</span> <span>to cooperate fully with MM and its affiliates in connection with any inquiry or investigation (whether formal or informal), and any defence or prosecution of any claims or actions;</span></li>

                <li><span>f)</span> <span>to notify MM and the Client as soon as possible if he becomes ill or is otherwise unable to provide services and to use reasonable endeavours to secure at its own expense a suitably qualified alternative Expert to provide the relevant Projects subject to Client acceptance of the suggested alternative (which acceptance shall be communicated through the Platform); and</span></li>
                <li><span>g)</span> <span>to be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations including Data Protection regulations and that it will comply with guidelines issued by the client including any expenses policies</span></li>

                <li><span>k)</span> <span> it will correspond with the Client only via the notified email link from the Platform</span></li>
             </ol>
             <h4>8. Payment</h4>
             <p>Following a Project Booking and receipt by the Client of a Project Confirmation, the Client shall be required to pay the Project fee stated on the Project Confirmation or, if relevant, the first instalment as provided on the Project Confirmation as well as any agreed travel expenses into a separately designated escrow account in the name of MM, details of which are on the Project Confirmation.</p>
             <p>The Expert will be paid her/his agreed fee less MM’s own fees after the Project or after a mutually agreed Project milestone has been delivered. MM will withhold all or some of the fee if the Expert has materially failed to meet its obligations.</p>
             <p>MM shall retain the agreed Project fee in the Escrow Account on the terms set out in the escrow terms published from time to time on the Website.</p>
             <em>Each Expert consents to the issuance by MM of self-billed invoices in respect of its fees. The Expert agrees not to issue its own invoices in respect of such deemed supplies. Each Expert shall inform MM forthwith on it ceasing to be registered for VAT, or following a sale of its business or the re-registration of it business under a new VAT registration number.</em>
             <p><em>MM may set off against any amounts payable to Expert any payment of any amount owed by Expert to MM (or to HMRC, if HMRC does, or is likely, in MM’s reasonable opinion, to claim any VAT from MM); and any payment made by MM shall be without prejudice to any claims or rights which MM may have against Expert.</em></p>
             <p>The Platform operates in $ and MM shall deduct from the Escrow Account such sums as shall be necessary to compensate it for any foreign currency losses suffered as a result of payments being made into or out of the Escrow Account in a currency other than $. The cost of such deduction will be borne by either the Client or the Expert.</p>
             <h4>9. Confidentiality</h4>
             <p>An Expert must not disclose any confidential information, including but not limited to the contents of this agreement all non-public materials and proprietary information, commercial secrets, and any information covered by any non-disclosure agreement(s) to which it is a party (“Confidential Information”). An Expert continues to be bound by this clause also after termination of this agreement.</p>
             <p>Should this agreement be terminated by any reason, the Expert agrees to return to MM or irretrievably delete any information relating to MM stored by it, as requested by MM.</p>
             <h4>10. Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
             <p>All materials made available to Experts on the Website, regardless of whether they are specifically marked, are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and remain the property of the copyright owner stated. MM has the agreement of the copyright owner to make these materials available and does so on a good faith basis without warranting the quality or appropriateness of these materials for specific Projects.</p>

             <h4>11. Use of Information Provided</h4>

MM also reserves its right to take such other action as it seems appropriate. MM also reserves its right to take such other action as it seems appropriate.</p>
             <p>MM shall also be entitled to cancel a registration if an Expert is served with a bankruptcy or winding up petition, or is otherwise unable to pay its debts as they fall due.</p>
             <p>An Expert may terminate its registration (subject to fulfilling any Projects bookings already committed to) by using the facility available in the Expert’s MM account. <strong>MM Expert account information is permanently deleted only after a suitable period of time has elapsed to allow for a review of the Expert’s MM Platform activity and/or ongoing commitments.</strong> </p>
